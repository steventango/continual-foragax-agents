# continual-foragax-agents

JAX-based RL agents (DQN, DRQN, PPO, RTU-PPO) trained on the
[continual-foragax](https://pypi.org/project/continual-foragax/) environment
family. Sweep tooling is built on
[PyExpUtils](https://github.com/andnp/pyexputils) and
[RlEvaluation](https://pypi.org/project/RlEvaluation/) and follows the
methodology in *Empirical Design in Reinforcement Learning* (Patterson et al.):
sweep hyperparameters at small scale, pick the best configuration per
algorithm, then run a larger production study with those frozen hypers.

---

## The workflow at a glance

Every recent experiment in `experiments/` follows these five stages. The
canonical worked example, used throughout this README, is
`experiments/E136-big/`, which produced the results for Figure 7 in the RLC submission.

```
1. Sweep                experiments/E136-big/foragax-sweep/ForagaxBig-v5/slurm.sh
                        ↓ submits hyperparameter sweep jobs (10 seeds, 1M steps), we use k%-tuning [1]

2. Pick best hypers     experiments/E136-big/foragax-sweep/ForagaxBig-v5/hypers_job.sh
                        ↓ runs hypers.py + generate_frozen_configs.py
                        ↓ writes configs with selected hypers and frozen configs into experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/

3. Full run             experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/slurm.sh
                        ↓ submits evaluation jobs (30 new seeds, 10M steps)

4. Process data         experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/process_data_job.sh
                        ↓ runs src/process_data.py

5. Plot                 experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/plot.sh
                        ↓ runs src/learning_curve.py + src/learning_bar.py
```

The two top-level directories — `foragax-sweep/` and `foragax/` — are the same
shape (`<experiment>/<env>/<aperture>/<alg>.json`). The sweep side carries
hyperparameter arrays and uses 1M steps; the evaluation side carries single
values selected by `hypers.py` and runs to 10M steps.

## Local development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (`pyproject.toml` requires `>=3.11, <3.13`).
- Rust (`rustup`).
- `swig` installed globally — `pipx install swig` or `brew install swig`. Needed
  to build `box2d-py`.

### Install
The project is a `pyproject.toml` package, so install editable into a venv:

```bash
uv sync
```

If you want pre-commit hooks:

```bash
bash dev-setup.sh
```

### Smoke test
Run a single seed of a real experiment locally:

```bash
uv run src/rtu_ppo.py -e experiments/E136-big/foragax-sweep/ForagaxBig-v5/9/PPO_LN_128.json -i 0
```

You should see training logs printing a progress bar. Let it run for a
minute, then cancel — this is your fast iteration loop while editing code.

The two in-use top-level entry points are:
- `src/rtu_ppo.py` — PPO and RTU-PPO.
- `src/continuing_main.py` — DQN and DRQN (continuing-task setting).

## Compute Canada setup

This works on Vulcan, and Fir — pick the matching cluster JSON
in `clusters/` when you submit jobs. The examples below lead with Vulcan
because that is what the `E136-big` example scripts use.

```bash
ssh vulcan
git clone git@github.com:steventango/continual-foragax-agents.git
cd continual-foragax-agents
./scripts/setup_cc.sh
```

`scripts/setup_cc.sh` does two things:

1. Loads `python/3.11 arrow/19 gcc`, creates `~/.venv` (the **launcher** venv,
   used by `scripts/slurm.py` itself), and pip-installs `PyExpUtils-andnp` and
   `ml-instrument` into it.
2. Submits `scripts/local_node_venv.sh` as a short Slurm job that builds the
   project `.venv` on a compute node (loads `opencv rust swig`, runs
   `pip install -e .` in `$SLURM_TMPDIR`, then copies the resulting `.venv`
   back into the project directory).

> **Edit before running.** `scripts/local_node_venv.sh` and the per-experiment
> `*_job.sh` files hardcode a CC allocation account (`rrg-whitem`,
> `aip-amw8`). Change the `--account=` line to your own allocation before
> submitting anything.

Wait for the build job to finish, confirm there is a `.venv/` in the project
root, and you are ready to schedule sweeps. Each new shell needs:

```bash
source ~/.venv/bin/activate      # the launcher venv
sq                               # check job status
```

## The sweep workflow

The five stages, each with its file in the canonical example.

### 1. Sweep — `foragax-sweep/<env>/slurm.sh`

`experiments/E136-big/foragax-sweep/ForagaxBig-v5/slurm.sh` is a list of calls
to `scripts/slurm.py`, one per algorithm:

```bash
python scripts/slurm.py \
    --cluster clusters/vulcan-gpu-vmap-24.json \
    --time 03:00:00 --runs 10 --force \
    --entry src/rtu_ppo.py \
    -e experiments/E136-big/foragax-sweep/ForagaxBig-v5/9/PPO-RTU_LN_128_HT.json
```

**Sweep configs** under `9/` (the aperture size) carry hyperparameters as
arrays. For example, `9/PPO_LN_128.json` sweeps `entropy_coef` over
`[0.01, 0.1, 1.0]` and three Adam learning rates. `total_steps: 1_000_000`
as per k%-tuning [1] (10% of the 10M-step evaluation budget);
`experiment.seed_offset: 1_000_000` keeps sweep seeds disjoint from
evaluation seeds.

**Cluster JSONs** in `clusters/` choose the resource shape:
- `vulcan-gpu-vmap-24.json` — vmap'd PPO across multiple seeds on one GPU.
- `vulcan-cpu-32G.json` — DQN on CPU.
- `vulcan-gpu-mps.json` — DRQN with NVIDIA MPS for GPU sharing.
- `fir-*.json` — equivalents for Fir.

Run with:

```bash
bash experiments/E136-big/foragax-sweep/ForagaxBig-v5/slurm.sh
```

`scripts/slurm.py` only schedules **missing** seeds — re-running the same
script after jobs finish picks up whatever didn't complete. When everything is
done it reports nothing to schedule.

### 2. Pick best hypers + generate frozen configs — `foragax-sweep/<env>/hypers_job.sh`

Once the sweep results are in, submit:

```bash
sbatch experiments/E136-big/foragax-sweep/ForagaxBig-v5/hypers_job.sh
```

This is a 1-hour CPU job that runs:

1. **`hypers.py`** — uses `RlEvaluation.hypers.select_best_hypers` on the
   `mean_ewm_reward` metric (mean statistic, threshold 0.05, prefer high) per
   algorithm. It writes the chosen flat config to
   `foragax-sweep/<env>/hypers/<aperture>/<alg>.json`, updates the production
   config at `foragax/<env>/<aperture>/<alg>.json`, and emits
   `choices.tex` / `default.tex` / `selected.tex` summary tables.
2. **`scripts/generate_frozen_configs.py experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/9`**
   — for every non-frozen config in that directory, writes a sibling
   `<alg>_frozen_500K.json` that adds `freeze_steps: 500_000` and renames the
   agent to `<alg>_frozen_500K`. These are used for the post-freeze transfer
   phase of continual experiments.

### 3. Full run — `foragax/<env>/slurm.sh`

`experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/slurm.sh` mirrors stage 1, but
points at the production configs (single hyperparameter values,
`total_steps: 10_000_000`, `seed_offset: 0`) and bumps the budget to
`--runs 30 --time 06:00:00`.

```bash
bash experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/slurm.sh
```

Idempotent in the same way — re-run to fill in missing seeds.

### 4. Process data — `foragax/<env>/process_data_job.sh`

```bash
sbatch experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/process_data_job.sh
```

A 100 GB / 16-task / 1-hour CPU job that runs:

```bash
python src/process_data.py experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5
```

`process_data.py` loads each algorithm's results, downsamples around milestone
steps (1M / 5M / 10M with widening intervals), and emits the aggregated
parquet that the plotting scripts consume.

### 5. Plot — `foragax/<env>/plot.sh`

```bash
bash experiments/E136-big/foragax/ForagaxBig-v5/plot.sh
```

Each line invokes `src/learning_curve.py` or `src/learning_bar.py` with
`--filter-alg-apertures <alg>:<aperture>` and `--metric ewm_reward_5` to
produce one figure per comparison. Tweak the filter list to add or remove
algorithms / apertures. Plots are written under the experiment directory.

---

## Pulling results back to your laptop

```bash
# on your laptop
bash scripts/sync_results.sh
```

You need to update it to point at your cluster and experiment directory. As
written, the script only rsyncs the aggregated `*.parquet` files (plus a few
videos) — enough to re-run the plotting scripts locally, but **not** the raw
per-seed result databases that `src/process_data.py` consumes. If you want to
re-run `process_data.py` off-cluster, broaden the rsync include patterns to
pull the underlying `results/` tree.

A sweep config is a single JSON file describing one algorithm and its
hyperparameter ranges:

```jsonc
{
    "agent": "PPO_LN_128",
    "problem": "Foragax",
    "total_steps": 1000000,
    "metaParameters": {
        "environment": { "env_id": "ForagaxBig-v5", "aperture_size": 9, "observation_type": "rgb" },
        "experiment":  { "seed_offset": 1000000 },
        "entropy_coef": [0.01, 0.1, 1.0],          // sweep
        "optimizer_actor": {
            "name": "Adam",
            "alpha": [1e-3, 3e-4, 1e-4],           // sweep
            "beta1": 0.9, "beta2": 0.999, "eps": 1e-5
        }
        // ... fixed hyperparameters
    }
}
```

The production config (auto-written by stage 2) has the same shape but with a
single value for each previously-swept field, `total_steps: 10_000_000`, and
`seed_offset: 0`.

## FAQ

**What's a good size for cluster jobs?**
Aim for jobs that run between 1 and 12 hours; ~3 hours is the sweet spot on
the Compute Canada queue. The vmap-based JSONs in `clusters/` (e.g.
`vulcan-gpu-vmap-24.json`) bundle many seeds into one job and are highly efficient. To estimate task count for a config:

```python
import experiment.ExperimentModel as Experiment
exp = Experiment.load('experiments/E136-big/foragax-sweep/ForagaxBig-v5/9/PPO_LN_128.json')
print(exp.numPermutations())
```

**How do I get code from my laptop to the cluster?**
Git. Push to a remote (private GitHub fork is fine), pull on the cluster. Tag
checkpoints (`git tag icml-2026-submission`) before destabilising changes.

**Some of my jobs failed / timed out.**
Just re-run the same `slurm.sh`. `scripts/slurm.py` detects missing seeds and
schedules only those. If it exits immediately and reports no work, that means
nothing is missing — clear out (or rename) the relevant entries under
`results/` if you want to force re-runs.

**Can I use GPUs?**
Yes — every `clusters/vulcan-gpu-*` and `clusters/fir-gpu-*` JSON is a
GPU-allocated template. PPO/RTU-PPO benefit most from `vulcan-gpu-vmap-*`,
which packs multiple seeds onto one GPU.

**Where does each experiment write its results?**
Under the experiment directory the config lives in, in the layout produced by
`PyExpUtils`. `src/process_data.py` knows how to find them given the
experiment root.
